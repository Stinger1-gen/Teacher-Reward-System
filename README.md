# TeacherRewardSystem Smart Contract

## Vision

The `TeacherRewardSystem` smart contract is designed to provide a transparent and efficient way to manage and reward teachers using blockchain technology. It allows the contract owner to add teachers, distribute reward points, and maintain a balance of ether that can be used for future rewards. The goal is to streamline the reward process and ensure that teachers are recognized for their achievements in a secure and immutable manner.

### Flowchart Description

1. **Add Teacher**:
   - The contract owner inputs the teacher's name and wallet address.
   - A new teacher is added to the system with a unique ID.

2. **Distribute Reward**:
   - The owner specifies a teacher ID and the amount of reward points.
   - The contract updates the teacher's reward points and emits a `RewardDistributed` event.

3. **Fund Contract**:
   - The owner sends ether to the contract to fund future rewards.

4. **Get Contract Balance**:
   - Anyone can view the contract's current ether balance.

## Contract Address

- **Test Network Address**: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`
- **Main Network Address**: `0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef`

*Note: Replace these addresses with the actual deployed contract addresses.*

## Future Scope

1. **Reward Claiming**:
   - Implement a function for teachers to claim their rewards in ether.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Introduce different roles for better access management and permissions.

3. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Develop features to generate reports on rewards distributed and teacher performance.

4. **Integration with Educational Platforms**:
   - Integrate with educational platforms for automated reward distribution based on performance metrics.
