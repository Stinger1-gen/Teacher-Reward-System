## Vision

The `TeacherRewardSystem` smart contract is designed to provide a transparent and efficient way to manage and reward teachers using blockchain technology. It allows the contract owner to add teachers, distribute reward points, and maintain a balance of ether that can be used for future rewards. The goal is to streamline the reward process and ensure that teachers are recognized for their achievements in a secure and immutable manner.


### Flowchart Description

1. **Add Teacher**:
   - The contract owner inputs the teacher's name and wallet address.
   - A new teacher is added to the system with a unique ID.

2. **Distribute Reward**:
   - The owner specifies a teacher ID and the amount of reward points.
   - The contract updates the teacher's reward points and emits a `RewardDistributed` event.

3. **Fund Contract**:
   - The owner sends ether to the contract to fund future rewards.

4. **Get Contract Balance**:
   - Anyone can view the contract's current ether balance.
